/*

This file contains tests for ::placeholder CSS pseudo-element
The ::placeholder pseudo-element represents placeholder text in an input field: text that represents the input and provides a hint to the user on how to fill out the form. For example, a date-input field might have the placeholder text `YYYY-MM-DD` to clarify that numeric dates are to be entered in year-month-day order.
